# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is a simple yet powerful blog built with **Next.js** and **Markdown**.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is an incredibly simple and powerful way to write content. Here are some benefits:

1. **Easy to learn** - The syntax is straightforward
2. **Version control friendly** - Plain text works great with git
3. **Portable** - Your content isn't locked into a specific platform

## Some Code

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about Open Source projects, so stay tuned for more content soon!
