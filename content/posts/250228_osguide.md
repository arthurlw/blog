_From a beginner, to beginners_

As someone new to the world of Open Source, it can quickly feel daunting. I still feel that way sometimes, looking at all the issues and pull requests that seem way out of my depth. But here’s the thing—there’s a way to push past that.

One thing I’ve learned? Everyone starts somewhere. Those issues and pull requests that look like another language? The maintainers and contributors who seem like absolute pros? They were all beginners once too. The secret?

**Start small—fix a typo in the docs, clean up a README, or even just testing some code and leaving a comment.**

My first pull requests were just fixing typos in the Python and Pandas repositories. Someone posted them as an issue, so I went in, fixed a couple of typos, added a few more examples, and submitted a PR. That’s it. Nothing groundbreaking, but it was a start.

Things start to click. You begin recognizing patterns, and before you know it, you’re reading issues, following discussions, and eventually, writing your own PRs. And the best part? The open-source community is generally welcoming—people genuinely appreciate contributions, no matter how small.

Yeah, it’s overwhelming at first. But if you keep at it, step by step, one contribution at a time, you’ll realize—you actually _can_ be part of it.



<!-- Note: This guide will continually receive updates as I learn more and more about the world of Open Source. At the moment I do not have a way of updating these posts, but I will figure something out later down the road. -->
