This is my first-commit in my Open Source Blog. 

I am currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and recently I have been looking to contribute to the world of Open Source.

This blog will be a collection of my thoughts and reflections on my journey into the world of Open Source. For people looking to get into Open Source, I hope this blog can be a resource for you :D

Stay tuned for more content!
