# First Commit

This is my first-commit. I am excited to start this Open Source journey! 

I am currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and was recently interested in the world of Open Source. 

This blog will be a collection of my thoughts and reflections on my journey into the world of Open Source. For people looking to get into Open Source, I hope this blog can be a resource for you!

I am looking forward to learning more about Open Source and contributing to the community!
